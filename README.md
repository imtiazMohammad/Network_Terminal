# Networking_Terminal

This project shows how we can take advantage of Java’s network
class library to quickly and easily write programs that accomplish
many common but unique and time saving networking tasks.
Some of these include:

* -help     | SHOW ALL THE AVAILABLE COMMANDS ON THIS TERMINAL

* newuser   | LOGIN INTO THE PROGRAM AS A NEW USER

* olduser   | LOGIN INTO THE PROGRAM AS AN EARLIER USER

* logout    | LOGOUT FROM THE TERMINAL

* myip      | GENERATE MY SYSTEM IP & COMUTER NAME

* netcon    | TO CHECK INTERNET CONNECTIVITY OF THE USER

* filedown  | TO DOWNLOAD A FILE FROM THE URL AND SAVE IT INTO SYSTEM

* sendmail  | TO SEND A MAIL ONLY BY USING JAVA NETWORKING

* GroupChat | TO RUN THE SERVER TO DISPLAY THE SERVER

* Members   | TO SEND MESSAGE TO THE GROUP AS A MEMBER

* Dreci     | TO RECEIVE THE MESSAGE THROUGH NETWORKING (UDP) PORT

* Dsend     | TO SEND THE MESSAGE THROUGH NETWORKING (UDP) PORT

* CreCookie | TO CREATE A COOKIE IN A DOMAIN VISIBLE TO SERVER IN DNS

* DelCookie | TO DISCARD A COOKIE FROM THE USER SIDE

* webpgsrc  | TO VIEW THE HTML CODE OF THE WEB PAGE

* webip     | GENERATE HOSTNAME & IP OF URL

* URLstats  | DATE, CACHE, CONTENT TYPE, P3P, SERVER, X-FRAME-OPT

* checkURL  | CHECK URL AND RETURNS RESULT IN THE FORM OF CODES

* URLinfo   | VAILDITY, PROTOCOL, HOST, PORT, PATH, FILE, QUERY

* pgtittle  | TO VIEW THE TITTLE ON THE WEB PAGE

* exit      | TERMINATE CODE


Output:-



Network programming in Java is one of the topics which remains
underrated or is seen as difficult. But in the real sense it is
completely opposite.

In fact, writing network programs in Java is designed in a way to
make the network processing quite simple and quick.
The Java core API includes well-designed interfaces to most network
features. Indeed, there is very little application layer network
software you can write in C or C++ that you can’t write more easily in
Java.

Hence this project helps to learn and take advantages of the built-in
Networking features in Java and to make the working on the internet
and web easier and quicker.
